    <section id="Biology"> <h4>Biology</h4> <p><i><b>Gondal biology" is most likely a misspelling of "gonad biology," which refers to the study of gonads â€“ the primary reproductive organs (testes in males and ovaries in females) that produce gametes (sperm and eggs) and secrete sex hormones. The term might also refer to the specific work of researchers like Mahnoor Gondal, a bioinformatics PhD student studying cancer, which is a different field of biology.</b></i></p></section>
